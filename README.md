# An-Intelligence-System-for-Medicine-Recommendation
Developed an intelligent medicine recommendation system using Decision Tree in Python. Predicted diseases based on symptoms and recommended doctors. Integrated a Tkinter GUI with Pandas and NumPy for data handling. Achieved ~92% accuracy using ML classification.

Project Title:
An Intelligence System for Medicine Recommendation

Project Description:
This project presents a machine learning-based medical recommendation system that predicts diseases based on patient symptoms and suggests suitable treatments and doctors. It leverages Decision Tree Classifiers to detect illnesses from input symptoms and recommend medical actions accordingly. The system integrates Python (Tkinter, Pandas, NumPy) for GUI and data processing.

The model is trained on a labeled dataset where symptoms are binary-encoded (1 for presence, 0 for absence). When a user inputs their symptoms through the GUI, the system classifies the likely disease and recommends relevant doctors using a separate doctor dataset.

Various recommendation approaches are explored:

Content-Based Filtering

Collaborative Filtering

Hybrid Systems

The project emphasizes enhancing early disease detection, reducing the dependency on physical consultations for minor illnesses, and assisting doctors with patient history-based treatment suggestions.

Technologies Used:
Python (Tkinter, Pandas, NumPy)

Machine Learning (Decision Tree Classifier)

Data Mining Techniques

Recommendation System Algorithms

Key Features:
Predict diseases based on symptoms.

Suggest appropriate medicines or treatments.

Recommend doctors for further consultation.

GUI-based interaction for easy use.

Comparative study of other systems using SVM, Random Forest, CNN, Naive Bayes, etc., for better insights.

Accuracy & Performance:
Combined ML models achieved up to 92% accuracy.

CNN-based hybrid models reported 94.8% accuracy in related work.
